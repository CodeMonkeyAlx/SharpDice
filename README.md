Hey, thanks for stopping in and checking out my little pet project. 
I am just in the process of learning C# as a language with intention of learning Unity after this.  

This project is not going to be anything special.  
I am not even promising its going to be optimized. 
However I would like to use this in a later project.  
Maybe even in a text game / RPG setting so it makes a little sense to build this. :D  
Anyway thank you for checking it out!
